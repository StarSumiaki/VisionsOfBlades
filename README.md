[Minecraft] Visions Of Blades
===============

*For Minecraft 1.8*

Remake of a remake of SwordsPlus, probably more faithful this time around.

I'll probably be pushing updates in chunks. Aka, new version == new github update.
Not gonna be one of those people who commits every tiny little change.

<h3>License</h3>
I'm stupid at license lingo.

You're welcome to peruse the code and even use it to help figure out your own mod stuff.
Just don't go rehosting it or modifying it and claiming it as your own (or some derivative thereof).

TL;DR: Don't be a butt and if you're not sure about something, ask!
